"""Pattern Generator 2.0 — sticking-block phrase generator.

Packs a small vocabulary of rudimental blocks (accented singles, odd 3/5/7
groupings, paradiddles) edge-to-edge to fill N bars, enforcing two rules across
the whole stream:

  1. Adjacent accents alternate hands.
  2. No more than two consecutive ghost notes on the same hand.

Every note is either an accent (uppercase) or a ghost (lowercase). Blocks are
stored canonically R-lead; the L-lead form is `mirror()`. Output is the existing
monophonic `Phrase` model, so it renders and plays through the same components.
